\chapter{Superconducting solenoid system for COMET experiment}
~~~~~~COMET phase-I experiment is aiming to measure the background and search the $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion with the sensitivity of 10$^{-14}$.
Its superconducting magnet system consists of pion capture solenoid, muon transport solenoid and detector solenoid.
In phase-II experiment, nowadays' 90 degree bent transport solenoid will be extended to 180 degree curved solenoid, and another spectrometer solenoid will be added.
 
 \section{Pion capture solenoid}
~~~~~~Pion capture solenoid shown in figure~\ref{capturesol} is most critical magnet for capturing the pions from production target with a large solid angle.
Considering the valleys of magnetic field causes the trapping of charged particle, the magnetic field distribution must be smooth.
The details of the magnetic design of pion capture solenoid is shown in table~\ref{magfldcs}.

 \caption{Schematic layout of pion capture solenoid.}
 \label{capturesol}
\end{figure}
All of the superconducting coils in pion capture solenoid is connected together with the same current provided by one power supply.
Furthermore, conduction cooling is employed in whole COMET superconducting magnet system to minimize the tritium production under high radiation environment by reaction of $^3$He(n,p)$^3$H.
Also the conduction cooling eliminates a helium vessel, which requires significant additional structure to the superconducting coil assembly resulting move heat load by the irradiation.
From all aspect, the conduction cooling is the best choice for COMET superconducting magnet system.
aluminium-stabilized conductors is used in all the coils for reducing the heat load and preventing the over heat of coils after quench.

 \label{magfldcs}
\end{table}


\subsection{Coils structure}
~~~~~~For stabilization and quench protection of the coils, superconducting wires are all merged with 5N aluminium (0.1\% Ni) due to its low density.
The aluminium stabilized conductor is chosen because aluminium is lighter than copper, which is employed as superconducting stabilizer popularly, such that it can be more transparent to the irradiation.
Here, 0.1\% nickel mixed is to enhance the mechanical property of conductor.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{chapter2/fig/coil.pdf}
 \caption{ Coil and conductor structure of CS1.}
 \label{cssrtu}
\end{figure}

The aluminium-stabilized conductor with the size of 15.0 $\times$ 4.7 mm$^2$ is wound with two layers of insulation tape, which is made of polyimide film covered by boron free glass with BT and epoxy resin.
Here, The reason why BT and epoxy resin is used because it has good mechanical property under the high radiation.
In addition, the insulated conductor is impregnated by the BT and epoxy resin mixed with silica filler during the coils winding.

The coil structure of CS1 and detail of design parameters are shown in figure~\ref{cssrtu} and table~\ref{desip} respectively.
There are 9 layers superconducting coils totally, and each layer is cooled by inserting 1 mm thick pure aluminium strip with RRR of 2000.
Each aluminium strip is installed between two conductor layers, and connected to the liquid helium cooling pipe.
Support shell with 5 cm thick is located on the top of superconducting coils to suppress the deformation of coils.

\subsection{Production target}
~~~~~~Production target is to make amounts of pions in the capture solenoid.
Phase-I is going to use the IG-43 graphite target rod with length of 60 cm, radius of 2 cm and density of 1.82 g/cm$^3$.
3.2 kW proton beam will deposit a heat load of approximately 100 W in the graphite target.
The temperature of target grows up to 190$^{\circ}$C at peak when 100 W energy is deposited in target.
A target support system accurately locates the target within the solenoid inner shield.

To achieve more pion production in COMET phase-II experiment, the target will be changed to pure tungsten rod with length of 16 cm and radius of 0.3 cm after the implementation of phase-I.
In addition, due to 56 kW proton beam power, phase-II target must be cooled on low temperature.
The proton beam also has to be fitted to a gaussian beam with 0.2 cm radius.

\subsection{Radiation shield}
~~~~~~A radiation shield is installed inside the CS and MS coils to protect superconducting coils from radiation.
This radiation shield has to be designed for both phase-I and phase-II experiment due to the high residual radiation.
The neutron came from production target directly is about 3$\times$10$^{12}$ n/cm$^2$/sec in COMET phase-II experiment, which corresponds to 10$^{24}$ n/m$^2$.
Both NbTi superconducting cable and stabilizers will degrade if they are irradiated by neutrons with over 10$^{22}$ n/m$^2$.
Therefore, due to a small radius of capture solenoid, a powerful radiation shield is needed to stop or decrease the radiation in short distance.
The most ideal radiation shield is made of pure tungsten with density of 19.25 g/cm$^3$.

However, to reduce the costs, a new radiation shield is necessary, and there are 3 candidates for the shielding design, which are the copper, tungsten and stainless steel.
Tungsten is most ideal material for shielding but it has bad thermal conductivity, thus, the water cooling should be installed into tungsten shield.
Copper has good thermal conductivity, but the eddy current will generate inside it during the hysteresis, so it needs to be cut in somewhere to prevent the eddy current.
Stainless steel has good shielding ability but higher residual radiation.
The detrails of shielding design will show in next chapter.

\subsection{Quench protection system}
~~~~~~Quench is caused by a hot spot in superconducting magnet.
When a hot spot quenches, temperature will rise suddenly, and propagate to all magnet.
Superconducting magnets has a risk of burn-out at temperature of quench.

Because the current becomes the joule heat after quench, decreasing the current quickly can suppress the temperature rise after quench.
There are two ways to speed up the current decay.
As shown in figure~\ref{dump}, one is to use the dump resistor in superconducting magnet circuit.
Once the quench is detected, the power supply will be turned off and current will flow towards to the dump resistor.
One quench protection diode is a switch for the quench protection circuit.
It is connected with superconducting wire and cooled to 4.2 K during operation.
The time constant is written as
\begin{equation}
 \tau = \frac{L}{R_{dump}}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the inductance of magnets and $R_{dump}$ is the resistance of dump resistor respectively.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.38]{chapter2/fig/dump.pdf}
 \end{subfigure}
 \hspace{0.2\textwidth}
 \begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.38]{chapter2/fig/heater.pdf}
 \end{subfigure}
 \caption{Schematics of quench protection circuit.}
 \label{dump}
\end{figure}
Higher resistance of dump resistor makes current decay quicker.
In the case of the pion capture solenoid, it is covered by the aluminium stabilizer.
Once quench is occurred, the current will flow into the aluminium stabilizer and copper matrix.
The current must decay more quickly due to the self resistance of stabilizer and matrix.
The time constant is written as
\begin{equation}
 \tau = \frac{L}{R_{dump} + R_{self}}
\end{equation}

Another way is to make the superconducting magnet quench to increase the self resistance by external heater.
It needs external power supply to heat the heater.

A tentative design of the quench protection system for pion capture solenoid is shown in figure~\ref{capture}.
All superconducting magnets in pion capture solenoid are connected together.
The power supply for capture solenoid is 2700 A, and 4 reserve trim power supplies and dump resistors are to reduce the current for TS1b, TS1d, TS1e and TS1f.
A dump resistor for capture solenoid is 0.185 $\Omega$, supposed the power supply is 500 V.
Once quench is occurred in one of the superconducting magnet of pion capture solenoid, the power supply will be turned off, and the magnet stored energy is extracted by the dump resistors.
As for the current design, the quench back heater will not be employed in pion capture solenoid due to the high resistivity of aluminium stabilizer after quench.

 \section{Muon transport solenoid}
~~~~~~The muon transport solenoid consists of 16 coils without stabilizer and a dipole coil with 0.056 Tesla compensating field is attached on the outer surface of each solenoid, which is shown in figure~\ref{transol}.
\begin{table}[H]

\subsection{Quench protection}
~~~~~~The coils in transport solenoid is not stabilized by aluminium and with high inductance.
To decrease the current quickly, the self resistivity must be high enough.
Thus, one semi-active quench back heater is employed in transport solenoid, which is shown in figure~\ref{transqu}.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{chapter2/fig/transport.pdf}
 \caption{Semi-active quench protection circiut for muon transport solenoid.}
 \label{transqu}
\end{figure}
Unlike to the pion capture solenoid, quench back heaters are installed in one quench protection circiut with superconducting coils.
Once a coil of muon transport solenoid quenches, the switch will be turned off, then current will flow to the heater.
Every heater will be actived by it own current and heat every coil in muon transport solenoid.

Diode is switch to prevent the current flows to the heaters during the operation and turn on the heater when quench.
In the case of muon transport solenoid, it operates in the cold mass (4.2 K).The radiation may cause the turn-on voltage reduced 
Considering the radiation may cause the degradation of forward voltage and temperature rising, the radiation test is described in next chapter.
