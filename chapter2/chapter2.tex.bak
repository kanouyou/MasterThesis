\chapter{Superconducting solenoid system for COMET experiment}
~~~~~~COMET phase-I experiment is aiming to measure the background and search the $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion with the sensitivity of 10$^{-14}$.
Its superconducting magnet system consists of pion capture solenoid, muon transport solenoid and detector solenoid.
In phase-II experiment, nowadays' 90 degree bent transport solenoid will be extended to 180 degree curved solenoid, and another spectrometer solenoid will be added.
 
 \section{Muon beamline}
~~~~~~To obtain the more precision branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, more stopped muon is required.
Stopped muon can be gained from two ways, increasing the operating time and increasing the muon beam intensity.
Since the most intense muon beamline over the world is located in PSI, and it only provides the muon with 4$\times$10$^8$, a new high intense muon beamline is necessary for future particle phycis.
Table~\ref{protonbeam} lists the nowadays' and future muon beamline, apparently, COMET muon beamline will be the most intense muon beamline over the world in future.

\subsection{Proton beamline}
~~~~~~To accommodate the COMET experiment, a new beamline (B-line) is under construction.
As shown in figure~\ref{bline}, A-line is the existing beamline from the main ring into the Nuclear and Particle Physics (NP) Hall.
B-line is a dedicated proton for COMET experiment.

Both phase-I and phase-II require a pulsed, 8 GeV proton beam slow-extracted from the J-PARC main ring into COMET experimental hall.
The proton beam intensity and production target for phase-I and phase-II is different, which is shown as follows.
In table~\ref{intens}, the requirement of COMET is compared with Mu2e as well.
Mu2e has a plan to operate for two years to take data, however, COMET only needs 280-day operation to reach the same sensitivity as Mu2e.

\subsection{Superconducting magnet system}
~~~~~~Superconducting magnet system plays a key role in pion capture, muon transport and signal tracking.
In the case of COMET phase-I experiment, the 8 GeV proton with high intensity is injected into superconducting magnet and hits the target to produce pion, then these backward pions are captured by pion capture solenoid, which provides 5 Tesla magnetic field at peak.
Muons with low momentum from the decay of captured pions are transported to stopping target by the muon transport solenoid with 3 Tesla.
Because the high momentum muon and the other particles will cause the background on detector, the muon transport solenoid is designed with 90 degree curve to throw out these particles.
After the muon captured by stopping target, the emitted electron from stopping target will be bent by detector solenoid which provides 1 Tesla magnetic field and tracked in cylindrical drift chamber (CDC).

The schematic layout of COMET superconducting solenoid is given in figure~\ref{solenoid}.
Pion capture solenoid consists of CS0, CS1, MS1, MS2 and TS1a-TS1f superconducting coils.
Meanwhile, muon transport solenoid includes TS2, TS3 and BS coils, and detector solenoid has 12 DS coils.

 \section{Pion capture solenoid}
~~~~~~Pion capture solenoid is most critial magnet for capturinf the pions from production target with a large solid angle.
Considering the valleys of magnetic field causes the trapping of charged particle, the magnetic field distribution must be smooth.
The details of the magnetic field of pion capture solenoid is shown in table~\ref{magfldcs}.

 \caption{Details of coils for pion capture solenoid.}
 \label{magfldcs}
\end{table}
All of the superconducting coils in pion capture solenoid is connected together with the same current provided by one power supply.
Furthermore, conduction cooling is employed in whole COMET superconducting magnet system due to the tritium production under high radiation environment by reaction of $^3$He(n,p)$^3$H.
Aluminum-stabilized conductors is used in all the coils for reducing the heat load and preventing the over heat of coils after quench.

\subsection{Coils structure}
~~~~~~To reduce the energy deposition in coils, superconducting wires are all merged with 5N aluminum (0.1\% Ni) due to its low density.
0.1\% nickel is mixed to enhance the mechanical property of conductor.

The aluminum-stabilized conductor with the size of 15.0 $\times$ 4.7 mm$^2$ is wound with two layers of insulation tape, which is made of polyimide film covered by boron free glass with BT and epoxy resin.
Here, The reason why BT and epoxy resin is used because it has good mechanical property under the high radiation.
In addition, the insulated conductor is impregnated by the BT and epoxy resin mixed with silica filler during the coils winding.

The coil structure of CS1 and detail of design parameters are shown in figure~\ref{cssrtu} and table~\ref{desip} respectively.
There are 9 layers superconducting coils totally, and each layer is cooled by inserting 1 mm thick pure aluminum strip with RRR of 2000.
Each aluminum strip is installed between two conductor layers, and connected to the liquid helium cooling pipe.
Support shell with 5 cm thick is located on the top of superconducting coils to suppress the deformation of coils.

 \section{Muon transport solenoid}
~~~~~~Muons are transported to the stopping target through the muon transport solenoid, which consists of curved superconducting magnets.
The muon transport solenoid must be designed to select the muons with low momentum and eliminate muons with high momentum ($p_{\mu^-} \textgreater$ 75 MeV/c), in addition, it also must be long enough for the pion decay.
Due to the beam dispersion in muon transport solenoid, the selection of charged particle depends on their momentum.
The magnitude of drift is given by
\begin{equation}
 D = \frac{1}{qB}(\frac{s}{R})\frac{p_L^2 + p_T^2/2}{p_L} = \frac{1}{qB}(\frac{s}{R})\frac{p}{2}(cos\theta + \frac{1}{cos\theta})
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the electric charge of particle, $B$ is the magnetic field, $s$ and $R$ are the path length and the radius of curvature of solenoid respectively.
$s/R$ is the bending angle, $p_L$ and $p_T$ [GeV/c] are longitudinal and transverse momnetum.
To keep the center of the helical trajectories of muons in the bending plane, a compensating dipole field parallel to the drift direction is applied, which is given by
\begin{equation}
 B_{comp} = \frac{1}{qR} \frac{p_0}{2} (cos\theta_0 + \frac{1}{cos\theta_0})
\end{equation}

The muon transport solenoid consists of 16 coils without stabilizer and a dipole coil with 0.056 Tesla compensating field is attached on the outer surface of each solenoid.
Details of each coil and design parameters are listed in table~\ref{tscoil} and \ref{designts}.
