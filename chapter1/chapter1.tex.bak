\chapter{Introduction}
~~~~~~The branching ratio of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ conversion is predicted to around 10$^{-15}$ by the physics beyond the Standard model such as SUSY-GUT, SUSY-Seasaw.
To obtain that experimental sensitivity which corresponds to the branching ratio for seraching $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ conversion less than 10$^{-17}$, a 8 GeV, 4.4$\times$10$^{13}$ pps proton beam is employed to produce high intense muon beam.
As the significant part of COMET muon beamline, the superconducting magnet system consists of pion capture solenoid, muon transport solenoid and detector solenoid, which must be designed for working under the high magnetic field and high radiation environment to produce amounts of pion.
Because the conduction cooling is employed in whole superconducting system, considering the cooling path of superconducting magets will degrade under high radiation, in this thesis, effects of radiation on superconducting magnet and its radiation resistance have been studied.

In chapter 1, the motivation of physics and COMET experiment have been introduced, which point out the importance of cLFV in the discovery of the new physics beyond the Standard model.

In chapter 2, the design details of superconducting magnets for COMET phase-I experiment, pion capture solenoid, muon transport solenoid and detector solenoid, will be explained.

In chapter 3, to investigate how much radiation will be produced in COMET experiment, Monte Carlo code is modified to carry out the calculation with COMET condition.
Using the real geometry of COMET experiment, the prompt radiation for phase-II and the resiudal radiation after phase-I experiment is estimated.
In addiation, one radiation shield is designed for protecting the superconducting coils of pion capture solenoid.

In chapter 4, the radiation resitance of the material and device, GFRPs, quench protection diode, insulation tape and pure aluminum, which are used in COMET superconducting magnet system has been tested.

In chapter 5, considering the thermal conductivity will degrade after irradiation, the most important CS1 coils where close to the production target is under risk of over-heat and burn-out.
Thus, the cooling and quench simulation is estimated.


\chapter{Charged lepton flavor violation}
~~~~~~Although the Higgs boson has been founded in 2012 by CMS and ATLAS collaboration~\cite{higgs}, there are no clues of new physics in last running with 3.5 TeV per beam.
the Standard Model still remains many unsolved problems such as neutrino oscillation, the lack of dark matter candidate, fine-tuning and matter anti-matter asymmetry.
On the other hand, it is known that the quarks and neutrinos are mixing as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, respectively~\cite{mark}.
However, as the same family with neutrino, it is strange that charged lepton flavor violation (cFLV) is still not founded.
As the prediction of lower branching ratio from the physics beyond the Standard model (BSM), new physics is possible to be probed through the cLFV.

Coherent muon to electron transition (COMET) experiment is planning to seek the cLFV channel of $\mu^- N \rightarrow e^- N$ from 2017.
To achieve the better sensitivity, the most intense muon beamline in J-PARC is under designing and construction.

\section{Charged lepton flavor violation}
~~~~~~In Standard Model, the neutrino oscillation is constricted and massless, in addition, the lepton number is totally conserved when they decay, like
\begin{eqnarray*}
 & \mu^- & \rightarrow  e^-  +  v_\mu  +  \bar v_e  \\
 L_\mu: & 1 & \quad\; 0 \qquad 1 \qquad\! 0 \\
 L_e: & 0 &   \quad\; 1 \qquad 0 \quad -1 
\end{eqnarray*}
where the electron lepton number $L_e$ and muon lepton number $L_\mu$ on left side is conserved on right side.
This decay is the ordinary muon decay and also called Michel decay.
However this is not the only decay for muon, all kinds of muon decay is listed in table~\ref{mudecay}~\cite{pdg}.

Unlike to the michel decay, decay mode of charged lepton like $\mu^- \rightarrow e^- \gamma$ has very tiny probability of decay, in addition, its electron and muon lepton number are not conserved on two sides.
The reaction like this is called charged lepton flavor violation.
\begin{table}[H]

 \begin{tabular}{cccc} \hline \hline
  Decay modes & Fraction ($\Gamma_i/\Gamma$) & Confidence level & Reference \\ \hline
  $\mu^- \rightarrow e^- \bar\nu_e \nu_\mu$ & $\approx$100 \% & & \\

 \end{tabular}

\subsection{cLFV in Standard Model}
~~~~~~The most popular explanation of charged lepton flavor violation in Standard model is one W boson is emitted through the neutrino oscillation~\cite{t2k} of $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$.
Feynman diagram of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-\gamma$ is shown in figure~\ref{muefy}.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.27]{chapter1/fig/SMmue.pdf}
 \caption{Feynman diagram of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-\gamma$ predicted by massive neutrino. cLFV occurs through a neutrino oscillation, and $\gamma$ is emitted from a $W^-$}
 \label{muefy}
\end{figure}
The treatment of neutrino oscillation for three flavors is developed by 3$\times$3 PMNS matrix with mixing angle, which is written as
\begin{equation}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  \nu_e \\
  \nu_\mu \\
  \nu_\tau
 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3} \\
  U_{\mu1} & U_{\mu2} & U_{\mu3} \\
  U_{\tau1} & U_{\tau2} & U_{\tau3}
 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
  \nu_1 \\
  \nu_2 \\
  \nu_3
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
To solve the neutrino oscillation, we start from the time evolution of the wave function, which is determined by the time evolution of the mass eigenstates and can be written as
\begin{equation}
 \mid\psi(\mathbf{x}, t)\rangle = U_{\mu1}^* \mid\nu_1\rangle e^{-i\phi_1} + U_{\mu2}^* \mid\nu_2\rangle e^{-i\phi_2} + U_{\mu3}^* \mid\nu_3\rangle e^{-i\phi_3}
\end{equation}
using the PMNS matrix, the probability of $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ can be described as
\begin{equation}
 P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e) = \mid\langle\nu_e\mid\psi(\mathbf{x},t)\rangle\mid^2 = \mid-4\sum_{k=1,2,3}U_{ek}U^*_{\mu k}sin^2(\bigtriangleup_{ji})\mid^2
\end{equation}
where $\bigtriangleup_{ji} = (\phi_j-\phi_i)/2 = (m_j^2-m_i^2)\cdot L/4E_\nu$.
$L$ is the neutrino oscillation occurring distance and $(m_j^2-m_i^2)$ is the difference between the square of neutrino mass.
Thus, the decay rate of $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ is fixed by involving the neutrino oscillation and given by
\begin{eqnarray}
 \Gamma(\mu^- \rightarrow e^- + \gamma) &=& \frac{G_F^2 m_\mu^5}{192\pi^3}\frac{\alpha}{2\pi} P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e) \nonumber \\
 &\simeq& \frac{G_F^2 m_\mu^5}{192\pi^3}\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\mid U_{e3}U_{\mu3}^*\frac{\bigtriangleup m^2}{m_W^2}\mid^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha$, m$_W$ is the fine structure constant and the mass of W boson.
The ratio of the partial width $\Gamma(\mu^- \rightarrow e^-\gamma)$ to the Michel decay rate gives the branching ratio
\begin{equation}
 Br(\mu^- \rightarrow e^- \gamma) = \frac{\Gamma(\mu^- \rightarrow e^- + \gamma)}{\Gamma (\mu^- \rightarrow e^- \bar v_e v_\mu)} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\mid U_{e3}U^*_{\mu3}\frac{\bigtriangleup m^2}{m_W^2}\mid^2 \textless 10^{-54}
\end{equation}

\subsection{cLFV in supersymmetry}
~~~~~~Supersymmetry (SUSY) is the most possible candidate in the physics beyond the Standard model, which can explain the hierarchy problem and Higgs' mass perfectly.
It is a proposed extension of SM by including the superpartner for each particle.
For instance, each ferimon has its superpartner, boson, and vice versa.
In the prediction of SUSY model which shown in figure~\ref{susyfy}, the cLFV is occurred by the slepton mixing.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{chapter1/fig/SUSYmue.pdf}
 \caption{Feynman diagram of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-\gamma$ predicted by slepton mixing. it occurs through its superpartner $\tilde{\mu}$ and $\tilde{e}$ mixing.}
 \label{susyfy}
\end{figure}
The branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ is given similarly to the SM by~\cite{kuno2}
\begin{equation}
 Br(\mu \rightarrow e\gamma) = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\mid\sum_{k}\tilde{U}_{ek}\tilde{U}^*_{\mu k}\frac{\Delta m_k^2}{m_S^2}\mid^2(\frac{m_W}{m_S})^4
\end{equation}
where $m_S$ is the typical scale of scalar masses, $\tilde{U}$ is the mixing matrix between sleptons and leptons, and $\Delta m_k^2$ is the square of mass difference between the kth and 1st sleptons.

From figure~\ref{susyfy}, the mixing $\Delta m_{\tilde{e}\tilde{\mu}}^2$ between a smuon $\tilde{\mu}$ and a selectron $\tilde{e}$ plays a key role in cLFV.
This slepton mixing parameter, $\Delta m_{\tilde{e}\tilde{\mu}}^2$ is given by the slepton mass matrix $m_{\tilde{l}}^2$
\begin{equation}
 (m_{\tilde{l}}^2)_{ij} = (m_lm_l^{\dagger})_{ij} + (\tilde{m}_l^2)_{ij} = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
  m_{\tilde{e}\tilde{e}}^2 & \Delta m_{\tilde{e}\tilde{\mu}}^2 & \Delta m_{\tilde{e}\tilde{\tau}}^2 \\
  \Delta m_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{e}}^2 & m_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\mu}}^2 & \Delta m_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\tau}}^2 \\
  \Delta m_{\tilde{\tau}\tilde{e}}^2 & \Delta m_{\tilde{\tau}\tilde{\mu}}^2 & m_{\tilde{\tau}\tilde{\tau}}^2
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $(m_lm_l^{\dagger})_{ij}$ is the lepton mass matrix and $(\tilde{m}_l^2)_{ij}$ is the term of SUSY breaking, respectively.
As the scenario of SUSY, SUSY-GUT and SUSY-Seasaw contribute to the off-diagonal terms.

\subsubsection{SUSY-GUT}
~~~~~Supersymmetric grand unified theories (SUSY-GUT) is the extension of grand unified theories with supersymmetry.
Three gauge coupling constants of electromagnetic, weak and strong interaction are unified to SU(5) coupling constant at scale of 10$^6$ GeV, which is also called GUT scale.
Due to the generation of the off-diagonal elements in slepton mass matrix, the cLFV is occurred with big branching ratio.
$\Delta m_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{e}}^2$ is given by
\begin{equation}
 \Delta m_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{e}}^2 \propto \frac{3m_0^2 + A_0^2}{8\pi^2}h_t^2V_{td}^*V_{ts}ln\frac{M_{GUT}}{M_{R_3}}
\end{equation}
where $m_0$ and $A_0$ are the universal scalar mass and the universal trilinear coupling respectively.
$V_{td}$ and $V_{ts}$ are the elements in the CKM matrix.
$M_{R_3}$ is the mass of the right-hand neutrino.
$M_{GUT}$ is the GUT scale ($\approx$ 2$\times$10$^{18}$ GeV).
and $h_t$ is the Yukawa coupling constant of top quark.
Figure~\ref{susygut} shows the prediction of the branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion with Ti target in SUSY-GUT model~\cite{kuno}, which is higher than the prediction of SM with the order of 10$40$.
Here, $m_{\tilde{e}_R}$ is the mass of right-hand electron, and $\mu$ is the parameter defined by Higgs and Higgsino.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.58]{chapter1/fig/gut.pdf}
 \caption{Pridiction of branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion in SUSY-GUT SU(5). Mass of right-hand $\tilde{e}$ can be observed indirectly if the $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion experiment gets more precision sensitivity.}
 \label{susygut}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{SUSY-Seasaw}
~~~~~SUSY-Seasaw model is another scenario for the prediction of cLFV by including the right-hand neutrino.
From the right-hand neutrino mass term, the slepton mixing can be obtained as well.
The slepton mixing between muon and electron depends on the solar neutrino oscillation and atomspheric neutrino oscillation~\cite{hisano}.
Thus, $\Delta m_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{e}}^2$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
 \Delta m_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{e}}^2 \propto \frac{3m_0^2+A_0^2}{8\pi}h_\tau^2U_{\tau e}^*U_{\tau\mu}ln\frac{M_{GUT}}{M_{R_3}}
\end{equation}
where $U_{\tau e}^*$ and $U_{\tau\mu}$ are the elements of PMNS matrix.
$h_\tau$ is the Yukawa coupling constant of $\tau$.
The prediction of branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ by SUSY-Seasaw is given in figure~\ref{susyseasaw}.
Similar to the prediction of SUSY-GUT model, it also predicts the higher branching ratio for cLFV.
\begin{figure}[H]

 \caption{Prediction of branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ in SUSY-Seasaw model.}

\end{figure}

\section{Seaches for cLFV with muon}
~~~~~$\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$, $\mu \rightarrow eee$ and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion are three main decay modes for cFLV seeking, and each mode has its different view in $\mu \rightarrow e$ transition.
In these modes, $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow eee$ belong to a dipole-type like interaction, however, $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion is a four-fermion like interation.
The effective Lagrangian which includes both dipole-type and four-fermion operators is given by~\cite{degou}.
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{1+\kappa}\frac{m_\mu}{\Lambda^2}\bar{\mu}_R\sigma^{\mu\nu}e_LF_{\mu\nu} + \frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}(\bar\mu_L\gamma^\mu e_L)(\bar q_L\gamma_\mu q_L)
 \label{phtoeq}
\end{equation}
%\begin{figure}[H]
 %\centering
 %\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{chapter1/fig/photonic.pdf}
 %\caption{\it Relation between dipole-like and four-fermion contribution in cLFV.}
 %\label{photonic}
%\end{figure}
where $\kappa$ is a parameter which governs the relative size of dipole-type and four-fermion operators.
Parameter $\Lambda$ represents the effective mass (energy) scale of new physics.
The first and second term of this equation are meant to the dipole-like ($\kappa \ll 1$) and four-fermion interaction ($\kappa \gg 1$), which correspond to $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, respectively.
%As the result of equation~\ref{phtoeq} shown in figure~\ref{photonic}, the energy scale of new physics is possible to be explored in the TeV range, which exceeds to the range of LHC.

\subsection{$\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$}
~~~~~$\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ is a 2-body back-to-back decay with monoenergetic $e$ and $\gamma$.
The way to search this decay is to reconstruct these back-to-back monoenergetic $e$ and $\gamma$.
The earliest $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ search dates back to 1947 with braching ratio of 0.1 (90\% C.L.)~\cite{1947}, and the most recent experiment for seeking this mode is the MEG experiment.

MEG experiment searches the $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^{+}\gamma$ in Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) with 3$\times$10$^7$ $\mu^+/sec$.
The data is taken from 2009 to 2010, and MEG experiment is now under upgrading to the phase-II experiment.
As the result, MEG collaboration presents a new upper limit on the branching ratio of this decay of 5.7$\times$10$^{-13}$ (90\% C.L.) with 3.6$\times$10$^{14}$ stopped muons on target~\cite{meg}.

Unfortunately, with the branching ratio of 5.7$\times$10$^{-13}$, there is no signal of interest founded finally.
The MEG-II experiment will start data-taking from 2016 to 2019 with 180 days per year and aim to reach the branching ratio of 6$\times$10$^{-14}$~\cite{megtdr}.

\subsection{$\mu \rightarrow eee$}
~~~~~The first experiment for seaching $\mu \rightarrow eee$ decay is taken in 1958 at Nevis cyclotron with the branching ratio of 3.0$\times$10$^{-5}$~\cite{lyn}.
Recent best branching ratio is 10$^{-12}$ which is measured by SINDRUM-I experiment.
A new experiment called Mu3e purposes to start from 2016 to reach a branching ratio of $\textless$ 10$^{-16}$ with the requirement of muon stop rate of about 2$\times$10$^9$ $\mu^+$/sec.
Mu3e has two phases, which phase-I and phase-II will taken in $\pi$E5 beamline and HiMB beamline of PSI respectively.

Unlike to $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ decay, $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^+e^-$ is a 3-body decay.
The reconstruction of signal of prositron and electron must be from the same vertex.
Thus, the challenges of Mu3e are the vertex, timing and momentum resolution~\cite{mu3e}.

\subsection{$\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion}
~~~~~$\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion is a different process from the other two, because the processes of $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow eee$ are detector-limited owing to accidental background, whilst, the $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion has no accident background but the background from beam, which depends on the beam qualities.
The past experiments for searching $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ conversion is listed in table~\ref{muehis}.
\begin{table}[H]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{cccc} \hline \hline
  Target & Upper limit & Place/Collaboration & Year \\ \hline

 \end{tabular}
 \caption{History of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ conversion experiments.}
 \label{muehis}
\end{table}
The most precision branching ratio is measured by SINDRUM-II experiment with gold target at PSI.
As shown in figure~\ref{sind}, there is one event found at high momentum region, but it just outside the region of interest.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{chapter1/fig/sindrum.pdf}
 \caption{SINDRUM-II experiment observes a $\mu^- + Ti \rightarrow e^- + Ti$ conversion with branching ratio of 7$\times$10$^{-13}$. Two signal is founded in high energy region but it is out of the range of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ signal.}
 \label{sind}
\end{figure}
COMET and Mu2e experiment are aiming to achieve the branching ratio less than 10$^{-17}$, which is 4 orders less than the previous experimental result.

\section{COMET experiment}
~~~~~~The COMET experiment is designed to search the following $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion and be carried out at J-PARC.
\begin{equation}
 \mu^- + N(A, Z) \rightarrow e^- + N(A, Z)
\end{equation}
It has two steps for serching cLFV, which are phase-I and phase-II.
phase-I experiment is to measure the background and search for cLFV because the $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion totally depends on the beam qualities.
phase-II experiment is to seach the $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion with the sensitivity of 3$\times$10$^{-17}$.
As shown in figure~\ref{comet}, 8 GeV proton hits the target to produce pions, then these pions are captured by magnetic field and transported to the stopping target to generate the signal of $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion.
The background measurement is taken at the end of 90 degree bending.

To achieve the experimental sensitivity of 3$\times$10$^{-17}$ which corresponds to the branching ratio, a total 2$\times$10$^{18}$ muons stopped in stopping target is needed.
Thus, the high intense muon source with about 10$^{11}$ $\mu^-$/sec is required for COMET experiment.
As for COMET experiment, one COMET dedicated beamline is under construction in J-PARC.
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{chapter1/fig/comet.pdf}
 \caption{A schematic layout of COMET. 8 GeV proton from B-line hits the target and produce pion first, these pions are captured by pion capture solenoid, and decays to muons in muon transport solenoid. Then, the muon with low momentum is captured by stopping target, meanwhile, an electron with 105 MeV/c from $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion will be transported to E-cal to take a measurement by detector solenoid.}
 \label{comet}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Background of $\mu^-N \rightarrow e^-N$ conversion}
~~~~~~In COMET experiment, once a $\mu^-$ with low momentum is captured by nuclei, $\mu^-$ will transit to the ground state of 1s.
During this transition, the specific X-ray is emitted from muonic atom.
In addition, the Michel decay in orbit (DIO) emits a electron and dominates the intrinsic background of $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion.
Without the direct background like DIO, there are many background such as beam related background listed in table~\ref{backg} will cause the undistinguishable signal in CDC during the reconstruction of signal.
\begin{table}[H]

 \begin{tabular}{cc} \hline \hline

 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Potential backgrounds for searching $\mu^-N \rightarrow e^-N$ conversion.}
 \label{backg}
\end{table}

\subsection{Signal of $\mu^-N \rightarrow e^-N$ conversion}
~~~~~~When the $\mu^-N \rightarrow e^-N$ conversion is occurred, the event signal of electron is mono-energetic with energy
\begin{equation}
 E_{\mu e} = m_\mu - B_\mu - E_{rec}
\end{equation}
where $m_\mu$ and $B_\mu$ are mass of muon and bind energy of the 1s monic atom respectively.
$E_{rec}$ is the nuclear recoil energy, which is given by $E_{rec} \approx (m_\mu - B_\mu)^2/2m_N$.
It is very small and can be neglected.
The signal depends on the nuclei, for instance, it is 105.0 MeV for Al stopping target.
This mono-energtic signal is beyond the background, and one tail behind electron background can be observed in $\mu^-N \rightarrow e^-N$ conversion.
